            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WEE, with the reſt of the people of God in this City, who are in ſcorn and deriſion called Quakers, have, for many moneths together, patiently, and in ſilence, born and ſuffered manifold perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from your ſelves, and the people of this Town, thorough your encouragement; without ſeeking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, though with a very high hand, and with exceeding hard meaſure, they have been executed upon us; waiting when the witneſſe of God in every one of your Conſciences (with which we are One, and which one day will witneſſe us, and our ſufferings, and the Truth, for which we ſuffer, eternally upon you, except you repent) would have been hearkned unto; which would have opened the eye in every one of you, which the God of this world hath blinded; and have ſhewn you Jeſus, whom (without a cauſe) in us you perſecute, and have filled your faces with ſhame for the evill of your doings; and have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed you to mourn over him whom you have pierced, with a bitter lamentation, even as a man that mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for his onely ſon; and have raiſed up in you the righteous principle of God, from whence true Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would have proceeded; that ſo the Cruell mockings, bitter revilings, illegal bonds and impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonments, and other groſſe abuſes, with which we have been by you, and thorough your means exerciſed, might have ceaſed, and you led to repentance; and the Salvation of your ſouls, which are pretious, in this great and notable day of the Lord Jeſus; After

<pb facs="tcp:168393:3"/> and how deſirous we are that you ſhould know, and be convinced of the evill of your way, and turn unto the Lord; We do herewit, hin the Cloſe of the year, before we publiſh it, preſent it to you, even to that of God, which is pure and juſt in every one of your Conſciences, to which we ſpeak, that as in a glaſſe with the light of Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the world was made, wherewith he lightens every one that cometh into the world, which convinceth you of ſin, you abiding ſtill and cool therein, may come to ſee what you have done, and the ſpirit and principle from which it hath proceeded, to wit, of Darkneſſe, and of the Prince of this world, who, throughout all Ages, as now by you, hath raiſed perſecution againſt the Principle of Light, the Seed of God, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures teſtifie; and that by him you may be delivered out of the ſnares of the Devil, by whom you are led Captive to do his will; And this is that which we wiſh and long for, even your ſalvation.

<pb facs="tcp:168393:5"/> have been the ſufferings, as in the following declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them is rehearſed), waiting, when the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God in every one of them, would have been by them minded, and they wearied in their manifold perſecutions of the innocent: And, as, when we ſaw, after ſo long forbearance, that they neither conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what they had done, nor laid it to heart, nor ſaid, it is Enough, We drew up together, and ſet in order before them, much of what they had done, and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how contrary it was to the Law of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Man,</hi> and to <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Humanity,</hi> to the end, that ſeeing their nakedneſſe therewith, as in a glaſſe, by the light of Jeſus Chriſt, ſhame might cover them: And, as, we have ſince waited for the ſpace of five moneths, to ſee, whether their iniquities being ſo laid before them, and ſo teſtified to their faces, they would <hi>bluſh,</hi> or be <hi>aſhamed,</hi> that ſo their <hi>tranſgreſsions might be hid, and their ſins covered,</hi> and what they have done againſt the truth be no more remembred by the Lord, or be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſed before man, which was, and is the deſire of our Souls (the Lord is our record) and the end both of our forbearance, and ſpreading of what they have done, before them; So now, through a deceived heart, which hath led them aſide, and a rebellious mind, which ſtill carries them on againſt the truth, thoſe ends being hitherto fruſtrated, and inſtead of them, a Violent <hi>perſecution</hi> having been, and being ſtill proſecuted, wherein they have impriſoned di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers for the teſtimony of Jeſus: whereby that which we drew up together, and privately delivered to them, and intended for the raiſing up of ſhame as a <hi>garment</hi> to cover their nakedneſſe, being by them thrown aſide, and that which ſhould be their ſhame, coming to be gloried in, which is all we have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:168393:5"/> heard from them in relation thereunto: We have brought forth to publick View at once what hath been done by them at ſeverall times, not in ſecret, but <hi>before the Sun.</hi> And thus <hi>openly do we reprove thoſe who have thus ſinned openly, and rejected private admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> if ſo be ſhame may yet overtake them, and they <hi>ſmite upon their thigh,</hi> and ſay, <hi>What have we done?</hi> And of their <hi>blood</hi> are we clear in the preſence of the great, and terrible God of Heaven, and Earth, whoſe witneſſe, what we have done, ſhall ſtand for him againſt them, in the day, when he ſhall come to judgment; which on them haſtens apace. And to that of God in every mans Conſcience ſhall we be made manifeſt, that we have not dealt with Them, as they have dealt with Us, or as men uſe to deal with an enemy; but with <hi>another ſpirit, rewarding Them good, whereas they have rewarded Us evill.</hi>

               <p>Theſe Officers coming to the houſe, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the door faſt, they knock thereat; the Man of the houſe going to the door, <hi>demanded their buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> They replyed, that the Deputy-Maior and the Aldermen had ſent them to ſearch his houſe for the men aforementioned, and to bring them before him; <hi>He demanded the Warrant;</hi> They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, they had none, onely by word of mouth: <hi>He replyed, without a legal Warrant he could let none into his houſe: and that he wondred the Deputy Mayor ſhould ſend</hi> thus <hi>to him, both on the laſt day of the week and then; in regard he was well known to have behaved himſelf peaceably and ſoberly, and to entertain none but ſuch perſons;</hi> whereupon they returned to the Deputy-Maior: A great <hi>concourſe</hi> of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple being, by the <hi>Conſtables</hi> thus coming, drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, who were rude, and endeavoured to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Conſtables into the houſe, though before
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:168393:49"/> the Magiſtrates met, and the Conſtables came, the ſtreets were quiet.</p>
               <p>About half an hour after, the Officers returned again, and told the man of the houſe (who held the door open in his hand) that they had now a Warrant to ſearch; <hi>He deſired to ſee it;</hi> they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed it, ſaying, The Warrant was their ſecurity, but they would read it to him: <hi>He replyed, his houſe was his ſecurity and defence; that he knew in what caſes, the Law allowed ſearches to be made. If their Warrant were legal they ſhould come in; but for hearing of it read he would not, he thereby being not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to know whether it were true or falſe, and that there were many tumultuous people at the dore, whom it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them to take courſe with, and to keep the Peace; For thoſe in his houſe, they were Chriſtians met together to wait on the Lord, and deſired to know, whether the Magiſtrates would diſturb them?</hi> They denyed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to let him ſee the Warrant, and told him, <hi>that it Was not particularly directed to him, Then he deſired them to give him a Coppy thereof, and if he ſaw it were according to Law, he would let them ſearch.</hi> They replyed they could not give a Copy of the Maiors Warrant, and with that <hi>forcibly attempted to enter,</hi> and afterwards offred <hi>violence to break it open;</hi> whereupon ſome of them departed again, and the reſt <hi>ſtaid about the door, which occaſioned the tumult very much to encreaſe, before their faces, which they appeaſed not, though by him required.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Afterwards they returned again, but refuſed to give him a Coppy of their Warrant, or to let him take a Copy, though he promiſed them to return it immediatly, and to let them come in,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:168393:50"/> if it were legal, and deſired to know his poſitive anſwer: <hi>To which he replyed, that they had offered vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to his houſe, not ſhewing him any Warrant, nor giving him any Coppy; that the ſtreet was full of tumultu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous people, which for ought he knew, attended their coming in, and what miſchief they and the tumult meant he knew not; Therefore he was reſolved to look to his own ſecurity.</hi> They told him the Magiſtrates would take it ill of him: <hi>He replyed, he had reaſon to take it ill of the Magiſtrates to occaſion his houſe to be thus aſſaulted, both then and at other times; and in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting ſuch Tumults on his houſe, and his peaceable friends therein, that his houſe was as free to him, as the Magiſtrates was to them; and therefore, where they required things contrary to Law, they muſt not expect therein obedience:</hi> All which he ſpake with much mildneſſe: So they departed, the <hi>Tumult</hi> being made up of ſome <hi>hundreds,</hi> who continued filling the ſtreets, and <hi>whooping,</hi> and <hi>hollowing, beating the door</hi> with other <hi>abuſes:</hi> the Conſtables permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them ſo to do.</p>
               <p>About the fifth hour, the meeting roſe, and a little before they departed, a Chief Conſtable being in the houſe obſerving the Ryot, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the former paſſages, went forth at the deſire of the man of the houſe, to require the Peace, and to cauſe every man to depart, for the Ryot was very high, expecting their coming out, but they regarded him not: and ſo they <hi>violently aſſaulted</hi> the people of the Lord wirh <hi>blowes, kicks, dirt, ſtones,</hi> and other <hi>vile abuſes,</hi> and <hi>reproaches,</hi> and <hi>cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> following them up the ſtreets.</p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:168393:50"/>
               <p> During this time (which from the coming of the Officers, was above two hours) did neither the Conſtables, nor the Magiſtrates keep the Peace, though the <hi>Councel houſe</hi> where they ſat, was at the upper end of the ſame ſtreet where the meeting was; and though ſome of the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſaw the <hi>tumults</hi> and <hi>abuſes,</hi> yet ſo far were they from doing their duty therein, and cauſing their own order of <hi>Seſſions</hi> to be obſerved, that Alderman <hi>Joſeph Jackſon</hi> and <hi>John Knolles</hi> Prieſt <hi>laughed openly on the Tolzey,</hi> as they ſtood and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thereon:</p>
               <p>Then the <hi>Tumult</hi> returned on the houſe where the <hi>meeting</hi> was, with more violence than before; <hi>aſſaulting</hi> the door and giving very opprobrious language to the man of the houſe with great <hi>cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor</hi> and <hi>rage,</hi> till the 7th. hour: and in what dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger he was could they have gotten in, may be well underſtood, and did manifeſtly appear by their words and actions; But during all this time the Magiſtrates did not endeavor the preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Peace, or require any ſo to do, though it was in the view and hearing of ſeveral of them.</p>
